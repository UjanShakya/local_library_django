# local_library_django

This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

The main features that have currently been implemented are:
<ul>
  <li>There are models for books, book copies, genre, language and authors.</li>
  <li>Users can view list and detail information for books and authors.</li>
  <li>Admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).</li>
  <li>Librarians can renew reserved books</li>
</ul>
